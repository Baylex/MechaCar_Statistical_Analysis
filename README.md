## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
insert image
1. Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
2. Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
3. Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

✓The csv file is imported and read into a dataframe. ✓An RScript is written for a linear regression model to be performed on ALL SIX variables. ✓An RScript is written to create the statistical summary of the linear regression model with the intended p-values. ✓The summary addresses all THREE questions.


## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

1. The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not? 
2. There is a summary that addresses the design specification requirement for all the manufacturing lots and each lot individually

✓The csv file is imported and read into a dataframe. ✓The total summary dataframe has ALL FOUR metrics for all the manufacturing lots. ✓The lot summary dataframe has ALL FOUR metrics for each manufacturing lot. ✓The summary addresses the design specification requirement for all the manufacturing lots and ALL THREE lots.


## T-Tests on Suspension Coils

1. briefly summarize your interpretation and findings for the t-test results. Include screenshots of the t-test to support your summary.

✓An RScript is written for a t-test that compares all manufacturing lots against the mean PSI of the population. ✓An RScript is written for ALL THREE t-tests that compare each manufacturing lot against the mean PSI of the population. ✓The summary addresses the results across all manufacturing lots and ALL THREE lots.


## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition
1. Write a short description of a statistical study that can quantify how the MechaCar performs against the competition. In your study design, think critically about what metrics would be of interest to a consumer: for a few examples, cost, city or highway fuel efficiency, horse power, maintenance cost, or safety rating.
2. In your description, address the following questions:
3. What metric or metrics are you going to test?
4. What is the null hypothesis or alternative hypothesis?
5. What statistical test would you use to test the hypothesis? And why?
6. What data is needed to run the statistical test?


The statistical study design has the following: ✓A metric to be tested is mentioned. ✓A null or alternative hypothesis is described. ✓A statistical test is well described to test the hypothesis. ✓The data for the statistical test is well described.
